The amount of a company's free cash flow is usually used to calculate how likely a company can make its dividend payments.

Dividends are cash payments made by a company to investors as a reward for continuing to own the company's stock.

If a company generates free cash flow that exceeds dividend payments, it's likely to be seen as favorable to investors. It could mean that the company has enough cash to increase the dividend in the future.
