Free cash flow represents the cash that is available before debt payments, dividend payments, or share repurchases. It's often used to represent the value of a company.

Free cash flow is typically calculated as a company's operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are made to buy, maintain, and improve physical assets, such as property, buildings, and equipment.

In other words, free cash flow helps investors determine how well a company generates cash from operations but also how much cash is used capital expenditures.
