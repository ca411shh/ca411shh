 Free cash flow is the cash left over for discretionary spending after subtracting money spent on capital expenditures from the money generated by normal business operations.

Operating cash flow, on the other hand, is the cash that's generated from normal business operations—like selling the products a company manufactures.

It's the money from which capital expenditures are subtracted to get free cash flow.
